# Lit

## Description

This is a project developed by Alberto Men√©ndez and V√≠ctor Perdiguer as the project for the second module at Ironhack.

The purpose of the application is to build a social app that allows its users to answer questions about other users anonymously.

The questions will always have other users as its possible answer, single choice only.

The results of these answers are then used to elaborate a leaderboard based on several categories.

Users can also propose new questions so that other users can answer them. These questions will have to be reviewed by the admin team before being allowed on the platform to avoid toxicity.
